Analyze this photo of milk production records and extract structured data.

Output fields per record:
- name: cow name or ID (string)
- liters: milk quantity (number with dot decimal)

STRICT pairing rules (very important):
- Pair a name with a liters value ONLY if a numeric value appears on the SAME ROW, horizontally aligned to the right of that name.
- Never copy or infer a value from the next/previous row. If a row shows a name but NO clear numeric value on that row, SKIP that name.
- Ignore nonâ€‘numeric prefixes like "B." or currency marks next to numbers; extract just the numeric liters.
- If multiple numbers appear on a row, choose the one closest to the name and most clearly aligned in the liters column.
- Do not average, sum, or guess. When unsure, skip.

Normalization:
- Use "." as decimal separator (e.g., 8.15). Replace commas with dots if needed.
- Do not include units or text in liters; only the number.

Return ONLY valid JSON in exactly this format (no extra text):
{
  "records": [
    {"name": "Cow 001", "liters": 25.5},
    {"name": "Margarita", "liters": 22.0}
  ]
}

If any name has no readable liters on its row, do not include it in the output.
